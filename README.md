## A New Bank

Welcome to my in-progress banking app. It is a very simple app that I am using to practice and learn. Feel free to follow my journey as I learn and grow.

# My First Solo Project

This is my first project that is not being done for a grade or to learn a particular skill. Instead, I am focusing on having some clear goals for my program and finding a way to achieve those goals. There will be some rough code in here, since I'm still learning. But, I've always learned best from doing.

# The Goals

My goals for this Banking app seem pretty achievable with where I am now. Here they are in list form:

* In it's simpliest form, have an app that can offer 3 basic funtions:
    * Have a balance
    * Deposit money, adding to the balance
    * Withdraw money, subtracting from the balance
* Find a way to store the information even when the app is closed.
    * In the beginning, most likely a simple .txt file I read and write to
    * EVENTUALLY, I would love to learn some basic SQL to communicate with a database
* Use that stored information to allow the user to create a permanent account
    * Add basic password functionality
* Create a simple GUI to navigate the app and login
